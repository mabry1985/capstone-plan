# Hole In The Wall
### When you wanna go where nobody knows your name

#### By _**Josh Mabry**_

## Intro
_This is my capstone project for Epicodus' Ruby on Rails / React Bootcamp. I wanted to showcase my wide range of skills as I attempt to join the tech community and become a full-stack React developer._

## Concept
_This project was inspired by solo dining ramen houses in Japan, where everyone sits at a bar separated into stalls after purchasing a ticket for soup at a vending machine. Food is served through windows in the wall by disembodied arms and everyone is expected to remain silent. I thought up the concept of a bar that ran in a similar fashion. Individual rooms where patrons place orders in a tablet at the table and receive their drinks through the window, a literal hole in the wall kinda place.

This project is what I envisioned this bar's point of sale / data system would look like from both an employee and customers perspective._
